    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>
      Ford is a family company, one that spans the globe and has shared ideals.
      We <br />
      value service to each other and the world as much as to our customers.
      <br />
      Generations have made their memories with us and included us in their
      hopes and <br />
      dreams. After 117 years, we’re used to adapting to and leading change.
      That’s why <br />
      we’re evolving to focus on services, experiences and software as well as
      vehicles.

      <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
      <p>
        Henry Ford transformed not only the automobile but <br />
        working life and the role of transportation. Having <br />
        played our part in everything from the birth of the <br />
        middle class to the recent global pandemic, we serve <br />
        the world with integrity and competence. The Blue <br />
        Oval is one of the most recognized corporate symbols <br />
        in history, continually striving to earn the trust of all <br />
        stakeholders.
